added use of dark sky api. discussed which parts of weather api to use. started with gps coordinates in google maps api.

chloeD -- 2016-12-06 14:04
met with everyone to see how things were going; cerated a schedule as a group to know who was responsible for what and what components are due when (will scan and upload when I get home); updated DESIGN doc (will redownload as a pdf and upload revised version)

today in class we went over our design document and got some feedback, which was overwhelmingly positive (we are keeping our weather and location idea, which is a change from the initial youtube/spotify idea, but we’re on track and the API’s have been tested!); I have started working on a schedule for the dates that portions of the project will be due (we are going to go over it tomorrow as a team to make sure everyone knows exactly what they are responsible for and for when)

chloeD -- 2016-12-06 17:23
updated and uploaded new DESIGN doc; uploaded schedule; check-ins with everyone tonight 

billyW -- 2016-12-06 18:32
abandoned google maps api for determining gps in favor of using openweathermap to determine gps via zip code. got api calls with dark sky api working. put in a try catch block to check if the dark sky api limit has been reached so that openweathermap data will be instead be displayed, once implemented (you can personally put a limit on dark sky api calls to test this)

haleyZ -- 2016-12-06 21:48
figured out how to compile a .proto file to allow me to read GTFS data that is provided by the MTA

haleyZ -- 2016-12-06 22:30
tried for a long time to figure out how to use the protoc stuff; gave up

haleyZ -- 2016-12-07 00:13
wrote up beginnings of getting subway status (manually parsing since the protoc stuff did not go well...)

haleyZ -- 2016-12-07 14:00
in class, finished the function to get table of subway statuses
