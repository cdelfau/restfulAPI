chloeD -- 2016-12-02 17:21
created repo, sent invites to repo for everyone to become "collaborators", made this text file, linked repo to a submodule in upgraded-parakeet

jamesW -- 2016-12-04 18:30
contributed to DESIGN doc

haleyZ -- 2016-12-04 16:15
researched APIs, registered for MTA API

haleyZ -- 2016-12-04 17:00
updated DESIGN pdf with site map and component map, clarified the purpose and features of the project

billyW -- 2016-12-04 17:48
updated DESIGN.pdf with information for the weather component of the project (component map)

chloeD -- 2016-12-04 21:59
read over DESIGN.pdf one last time and push it to the git

billyW -- 2016-12-05 14:01
got a basic sample with openweathermap api working

haleyZ -- 2016-12-06 14:00
researched more about GTFS format that the MTA uses

jamesW -- 2016-12-06 14:00
Began working on a base template as well as some authentication functions.

billyW -- 2016-12-06 14:03
added use of dark sky api. discussed which parts of weather api to use. started with gps coordinates in google maps api.

chloeD -- 2016-12-06 14:04
met with everyone to see how things were going; cerated a schedule as a group to know who was responsible for what and what components are due when (will scan and upload when I get home); updated DESIGN doc (will redownload as a pdf and upload revised version)

chloeD -- 2016-12-05 16:29
today in class we went over our design document and got some feedback, which was overwhelmingly positive (we are keeping our weather and location idea, which is a change from the initial youtube/spotify idea, but we’re on track and the API’s have been tested!); I have started working on a schedule for the dates that portions of the project will be due (we are going to go over it tomorrow as a team to make sure everyone knows exactly what they are responsible for and for when)

chloeD -- 2016-12-06 17:23
updated and uploaded new DESIGN doc; uploaded schedule; check-ins with everyone tonight

billyW -- 2016-12-06 18:32
abandoned google maps api for determining gps in favor of using openweathermap to determine gps via zip code. got api calls with dark sky api working. put in a try catch block to check if the dark sky api limit has been reached so that openweathermap data will be instead be displayed, once implemented (you can personally put a limit on dark sky api calls to test this)

haleyZ -- 2016-12-06 21:48
figured out how to compile a .proto file to allow me to read GTFS data that is provided by the MTA

haleyZ -- 2016-12-06 22:30
tried for a long time to figure out how to use the protoc stuff; gave up

haleyZ -- 2016-12-07 00:13
wrote up beginnings of getting subway status (manually parsing since the protoc stuff did not go well...)

haleyZ -- 2016-12-07 14:00
in class, finished the function to get table of subway statuses

chloeD -- 2016-12-07 14:05
met with everyone to check in with them (see what they did so far, what problems they ran into, regrouped and planned some potential additional functionalities); updated the DESIGN doc to better reflect our plans

billyW -- 2016-12-07 14:06
added a return type for the weather function

jamesW -- 2016-12-07 17:16
Added login and registration functionality

billyW -- 2016-12-07 19:38
adjusted weather api keys location and changed code to fit

jamesW -- 2016-12-07 19:51
Created basic layout for the home page

billyW -- 2016-12-08 14:01
looked at google maps embed and last.fm apis

chloeD —- 2016-12-08 14:05
met with everyone; facilitated discussions amongst members to help plan for component merging; helped plan for additional components because Billy finished with eh weather stuff

haleyZ —- 2016-12-08 17:00
successfully pull the locations of the buses en route using SIRI API; ran into issue with getting all stops on the route using OBA API...

haleyZ -- 2016-12-09 10:10
worked on getting the buses that are approaching a certain stop.

jamesW -- 2016-12-09 11:49
Added basic form on the home page

chloeD -- 2016-12-09 13:57
met with each member to discuss the work that they have done, solve problems (paticularly the bus problem!), and plan for work over the weekend

haleyZ -- 2016-12-09 14:05
using the destination of buses to filter the ones going N or S

haleyZ -- 2016-12-10 00:25
previous approach of filtering destinations didn't work out. ditched the idea. finished the function that makes an html dropdown of the bus stops on a given route.

haleyZ -- 2016-12-10 17:02
generalized functions that returned subway status to make them also work for LIRR status. Finished function that gets LIRR status.

jamesW -- 2016-12-11 10:02
Integrated weather function ality with the front end.

jamesW -- 2016-12-11 14:02
Integrated transit functionality with the front end.

billyW -- 2016-12-11 21:46
added an util that gets top tracks. (is it accurate/trustworthy?)

chloeD -- 2016-12-11 23:12
confirmed with all members that their parts were working, especially James and Haley, to make sure Haley’s transportation information would be displayed properly; plan to use Monday as a way to regroup and make sure everything is A+

haleyZ -- 2016-12-11 23:27
reordered transit display. made jinja ifs to only display the tabs for the transit options selected

jamesW -- 2016-12-12 13:58
Added embeded map to the result page

haleyZ -- 2016-12-12 13:03
robustify for bus nums that don't exist.

billyW -- 2016-12-12 20:49
changed topTracks util to get 10 random top songs, instead of the top 10 most popular songs. bug: has a ~1/450 of chosing the same song twice.
