To successfully use our program:

First, create a .env file at the root of the restfulAPI folder where you will paste in all 4 of our API keys. 

Second, activate your virtual environment and then go to our restfulAPT folder. Run the code by doing the command: python app.py 

Then, copy paste the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into your browser. Once you arrive at the homepage you can do 2 things. First, test out our program (without registering for an account/logging in). All you have to do is input a zipcode. Providing only a zipcode will give you only the weather for that area once you search. Any additional transportation options that you check will be shown as well. Note that if you forget to put in a bus number, even if you select the bus checkbox, you will not get an error. You will get transportation service updates for all the transportation you select. You will also see a Google Maps map embedded at the top of the page of the area defined by the zipcode you provided.

If you choose to register for an account, it's quite simple. All you have to do is click "Register" where you will give us a username, password, and confirm password. If you do that successfully, you can click "Login" and login with your username and password (nothing special in our account/register/log in stuff -- it's pretty self-explanatory!). Once you log in, you will see the same form askign for a zipcode, different modes of transport, and a borough. Below that, you will see a little "Save" checkbox. If you hover over it you can see what it does. If you don't want to and you just want me to tell you, then stay tuned! The "Save" option is really cool. It lets you set a particular zipcode, mode(s) of transport, and borough as your default information. If you log out and then log back in, you'll see that your default homepage is now changed to your default zipcode/transportation. You'll get all teh weather info for that zipcode and all the transportation info you care about just by logging in! Of course, even if you're logged in, you may want to look at other information for other zipcodes or transportation, which is totally fine. You can click the "New Search" and search up a new location. An additional feature that comes with having an account is the random playlist generator. When you log in, in addition to getting your area's weather and transportation, you also get 10 random songs that you can use as inspiration to listen to on your commute!

Enjoy!
